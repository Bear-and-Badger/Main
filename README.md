The Bear and Badger
====
The GitHub repo for those of distinguished taste
----


This is the main source for the Bear and Badger forum, currently found (surprisingly enough) at http://thebearandbadger.co.uk

It is built using the quite lovely and open source Vanilla Forums: http://vanillaforums.org/

Feel free to browse, pull-apart, contribute or clone. If you do decide to use this as the base for a new forum,
it would be appreciated if you didn't use any of the included branding; but other than that, feel free to help yourself.

The particularly 'unique' or interesting bits that belong to me are:

 - The 'bears' theme
 - SimpleSpoilers plugin
 - SimpleVideo plugin
 - SimpleImages plugin
 - SCEditor Plugin
 - GamingNetworks plugin

This will by and large be the definitive source, so as I roll out improvements this repo will be updated accordingly.


If you wish to run this yourself, you will need a webserver, PHP and MySQL. Apache is preferred due to the use of
.htaccess files for pretty URLs, but it's up to you.

You'll need to add DB config settings into the /conf/config file - I have no idea how nicely this will play if you
don't already have a Vanilla database installation setup, but if you find a way of making life easier then let me know.

Regards,
